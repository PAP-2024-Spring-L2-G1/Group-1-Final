                <h5>Adopting legislative, administrative and policy frameworks</h5>
                <p>By the end of 2022, the legislative, administrative and policy measures had 
                increased through the implementation of laws by 68 countries worldwide in relation to 
                the <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/about">Nogoya Protocol</a> Protocol. Alongside this, 88 countries put in place measures for the implementation 
                of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.</p>

            <div id="card2"><h3>Restoration of degraded land </h3>
                <br>
                <p>The land that is either no longer needed or has become degraded needs to be restored.
                    So that the original ecosystem, biodiversity, and natural cycles can go back to as they once were before.
                    By doing so we can restore some of the land that we took over for purposes like agriculture or mining.</p>

            <div id="card3"><h3>Stop expanding agriculture footprint</h3>
                <p>Stop the expansion of agricultural land, like the ones that are eating up tropical forests and savannas.
                    By doing this we can reduce the amount of forests we cut down,
                    which also reduces carbon emissions.</p>

                <h5>Integrate ecosystem and biodiversity values into national and local planning</h5>
                <p>In regards to biodiversity, there have been an increase in the number of countries incorporating these values into their accounting and reporting systems.
                    Including the 92 countries that have indicated implementation of
                    the <a href="https://seea.un.org/">System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)</a> as of 2023.</p>
