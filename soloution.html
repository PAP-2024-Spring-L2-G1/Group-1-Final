        <h1>Soloutions and UN Goals</h1>
        <div id="card1"><h3>Target 15.6</h3>
            <p>By the end of 2022, the legislative, administrative and policy measures had 
            increased through the implementation of laws by 68 countries worldwide in relation to 
            the Nagoya Protocol. Alongside this, 88 countries put in place measures for the implementation 
            of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.</p>

        <div id="card2"><h3>Restoration of degraded land </h3>
            <p>
                The land that is either no longer needed or has become degraded needs to be restored.
                So that the original ecosystem, biodiversity, and natural cycles can go back to as they once were before.
                By doing so we can restore some of the land that we took over for purposes like agriculture or mining.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="card3"><h3>Stop expanding agriculture footprint</h3>
            <p>Stop the expansion of agricultural land, like the ones that are eating up tropical forests and savannas.
                By doing this we can reduce the amount of forests we cut down,
                which also reduces carbon emissions.</p>
