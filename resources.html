                <p>Around 44% of the world’s habitable land goes to farm land, which is about 5 times the size of the U.S. But only 55 % of the food grown go towards feeding people, while 36% of it go towards feeding livestock, and the remaining amount go towards bio fuel, and other industrial usages.</p>
                <p>The impacts of taking over these land, and remaking them into farmland has caused: </p>
